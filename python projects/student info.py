# Title:
#   A student information system project.
#Description:
#     As a professional student,I am excited to share my recent project, a student information system built using python.'this project demonstrates how python can be used to create a robust and efficient system for managing student data.
# project overiew:
#    the student information system is designed to store and manage student information,including:
#                          1.student name & age
#                          2.grades & marks
#                          3.courses & attendance
#                          4.CGPA  & scholarship details
# code:
#student data
student_name="john"#string
student_age=20#integer
student_marks=[90,98,99]#list
student_courses={"ajay":"A","vinay":"B","vijay":"C"}#dictionary
student_Cgpa=98.8#float
student_scholarship=True#boolean
student_scholarship_money=900+2j#complex
student_subjects=("maths","physics","chemistry")#tuple
student_subject_code={1,2,3}#set
#display student data
print(student_name,type(student_name))
print(student_age,type(student_age))
print(student_marks,type(student_marks))
print(student_courses,type(student_courses))
print(student_Cgpa,type(student_Cgpa))
print(student_scholarship,type(student_scholarship))
print(student_scholarship_money,type(student_scholarship_money))
print(student_subjects,type(student_subjects))
print(student_subject_code,type(student_subject_code))
#key featues:
#    1.user-friendly interface for displaying student data.
#    2.data validation and error handling for ensuring data accuracy.
#    3.calculations for student grade and CGPA.
#    4.data visualization for student performance analysis.
#technologies used:
#   python 3.x
#   data structures(numeric,sequence,set,dict,boolean)
# benefits:
#   efficient data management and retrieval. 
#   improved accuracy and reduced errors.
#   enhanced student performance analysis and reporting.
#   scalable and adaptable design.
# takeaways:
#   python's simplicity and flexibility make it an ideal choice for building efficient data management systems.
#   proper data validation and error handling and error handling are crucial for ensuring data accuracy and integrity.
#   data visualization can provide valuable insights into student performance and help identify area for improvement.
